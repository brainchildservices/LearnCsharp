                <h3>What is C# String?</h3>
                <p>In C#, a string is a series of characters that is used to represent text. It can be a character, a word or a long passage surrounded with the double quotes ". C# provides the String data type to store string literals.</p>

                <h3>What is String Length?</h3>
                <p id="centerpara">Returns the number of characters in a string. <a href="(https://dotnetfiddle.net/yfdtQ6)">Example:</a></p>
                <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                    using System;

                    public class Program
                    {
                        public static void Main()
                        {
                            string name = "Tiago";
                    int nameLength = name.Length;
                    Console.WriteLine("The name " + name + " contains " + nameLength + " letters.");
                        }
                    }

                    //Output: will show the stringname and stringlength.

                <h3>What do you mean by String Concatenation?</h3>
                <p>The + operator can be used between strings to combine them. This is called concatenation.</p>
                <h6>Example</h6>
                <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                    string firstName = "Brain";
                    string lastName = "Child";
                    string name = firstName + lastName;
                    Console.WriteLine(name);

                    //Output: BrainChild
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is String Interpolation?</h3>
                <p>Another option of string concatenation, is string interpolation, which substitutes values of variables into placeholders in a string. Note that you do not have to worry about spaces, like with concatenation:</p>
                <h6>Example</h6>
                <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                    string firstName = "Brain";
                    string lastName = "Child";
                    string name = $"My full name is: {firstName}{lastName}";
                    Console.WriteLine(name);

                    //Output: BrainChild
                </code></pre>

                <h3>How to access each character of a string?</h3>
                <p>You can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [ ].</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
                    string myString = "Hello";
                    Console.WriteLine(myString[0]);

                    //Output: H
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is String.Format?</h3>
                <p>String.Format( ) method formats strings in a desired format by inserting objects and variables with specified space and alignments into another strings and literals. It is also often used to format strings into specific formats.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://dotnetfiddle.net/2dBw4w" target="_blank">Example:</a></h3>
                <pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
