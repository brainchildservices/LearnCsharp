			<h3>CS Statements</h3>
			<p>The actions of a program are expressed using statements. C# supports several different kinds of statements, a number of which are defined in terms of embedded statements.</p>
			<p>A block: permits multiple statements to be written in contexts where a single statement is allowed. A block consists of a list of statements written between the delimiters { and }.</p>
			<p>Declaration statements: are used to declare local variables and constants.</p>
			<p>Expression statements: are used to evaluate expressions. Expressions that can be used as statements include method invocations, object allocations using the new operator, assignments using = and the compound assignment operators, increment and decrement operations using the ++ and -- operators and await expressions.</p>
		</section>
			<section>
			<p>Selection statements: are used to select one of a number of possible statements for execution based on the value of some expression. This group contains the if and switch statements.</p>
			<p>Iteration statements: are used to execute repeatedly an embedded statement. This group contains the while, do, for, and foreach statements.</p>
				</code></pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>Jump statements: are used to transfer control. This group contains the break, continue, goto, throw, return, and yield statements.</p>
				<p>The try...catch statement: is used to catch exceptions that occur during execution of a block, and the try...finally statement is used to specify finalization code that is always executed, whether an exception occurred or not.</p>
				<p>The checked and unchecked statements: are used to control the overflow-checking context for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.</p>
				<p>The lock statement: is used to obtain the mutual-exclusion lock for a given object, execute a statement, and then release the lock.</p>
				<p>The using statement: is used to obtain a resource, execute a statement, and then dispose of that resource.</p>
